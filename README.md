# ParkiSense: Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Voice Data and Multiple ML Algorithms

Welcome to the ParkiSense project! This initiative focuses on the detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) through the analysis of voice features using various machine learning algorithms. We compare several models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Neural Networks. Additionally, we explore hybrid models (e.g., Logistic Regression + NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest + Logistic Regression) to determine the most effective approach for early PD detection.

## ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Detection App

This project features a user-friendly application built with Streamlit, designed to detect Parkinson's disease based on voice features.

## ðŸš€ Running the Streamlit App

To set up and run the Streamlit application in a virtual environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code and execute the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
