# ParkiSense-Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Voice Data and Multiple ML Algorithms
This project explores Parkinsonâ€™s Disease detection using voice features and machine learning. It compares algorithms like KNN, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, alongside hybrid models (e.g., LR+NB, RF+LR), to identify the most effective approach for early PD detection.

# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Detection App

This project uses Streamlit and a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease based on voice features.

## ðŸš€ Running the Streamlit App

Follow these steps to set up and run the Streamlit application in a virtual environment.
Use Terminal in the VS code
